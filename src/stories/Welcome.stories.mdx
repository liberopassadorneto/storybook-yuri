# Welcome to the BR24's Storybook

Storybook Design System is a reusable component library that helps Storybook contributors build UIs faster. The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

## Contextualization

BR24's apps does not have a visual and component standard. Hence, generating disharmony in the BR24's products and makes maintenance difficult in new implementations.

## Use case

Based on the Design System, this Storybook was created for the BR24's products. Therefore, this Storybook is the standard for any future development.

## Tecnology

This Storybook was created using Vue.js.
